# Linear regression

- 

- why prior: 
first: make more certainty in our models and collected data
second: sampling from a posterior distribution, we get a better estimator of the parameters measured

This does not mean we can include several priors to enhance our models...

posterior = (is proportional to) likelihood x prior
